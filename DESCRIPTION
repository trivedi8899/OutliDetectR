Description: 
    The OutliDetectR package implements a novel hybrid method for simultaneous 
    outlier detection and missing value imputation based on the OMV (Outlier-Missing Value) score. 
    This score combines Mahalanobis Distance, Local Outlier Factor (LOF), and Isolation Forest 
    for robust outlier detection, while also accounting for missing data impact using 
    techniques such as KNN imputation and missForest. The final OMV score is computed 
    using a weighted combination of anomaly score and missingness severity. 
    Designed for use with both low and high-dimensional data, it helps researchers 
    detect, analyze, and correct anomalous records efficiently.
